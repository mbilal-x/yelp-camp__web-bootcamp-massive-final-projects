let's cover one section a day. this way we will cover the course in 20 days. [under a month].

otherwise, it will get to far. and our goals would be effected by this neglect. :) .PEACE. 

got distracted for a bit by a few things:
- laptop causing problems
- me loosing sight of the vision
- procrastination on side contents

I start again today. Github would keep track of streak.



This is not fun to work on as I have alot of loopholes in my understanding.
should have practiced each seperate concept on a seperate tiny project before integrating it into something this big and complicated. // working on js practice on the side. 

Today 1st July 2023 I continue this project. I plan to finish this project and the udemy course and learn React properly over the summers. With the goal of becoming a good MERN developer with a cool portfolio and start generating income from this. 

I have 1 month to start making income: 
I have to do atleast 3-sections per day to finish 35-hours in under 15 days and use the next 15 days to make portfolio and get paid projects.
