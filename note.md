let's cover one section a day. this way we will cover the course in 20 days. [under a month].

otherwise, it will get to far. and our goals would be effected by this neglect. :) .PEACE. 

got distracted for a bit by a few things:
- laptop causing problems
- me loosing sight of the vision
- procrastination on side contents

I start again today. Github would keep track of streak.



This is not fun to work on as I have alot of loopholes in my understanding.
should have practiced each seperate concept on a seperate tiny project before integrating it into something this big and complicated.
